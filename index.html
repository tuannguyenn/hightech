<!-- Note from Tuan:
for now I added style2.css for all the pages besides the index so they format correctly.

I noticed all the images were pretty big filesizes and were making the pictures load slow so I resized them accordingly and put the original sized images in the img_homepg/big_img

I changed the text color to white and the font to Calibri but for some reason cloud9 isn't updating the CSS

I reuploaded everything to a new folder called captest and now it seems to be working... then i changed the name of this capstone folder to Capstonee  and now it seems to work, so i deleted the captest folder

I fixed the position of the navigation bar on the home page so it lines up with the other pages hopefully
